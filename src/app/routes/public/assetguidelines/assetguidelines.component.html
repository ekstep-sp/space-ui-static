    <!-- <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Asset Guidelines</strong></span></p> -->
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">To foster constant and rapid evolution of innovations, assets would have to be
        created
        and used, and should enable collaboration and co-creation among diverse people. Thus, standards play an
        important role in defining certain requirements and guidelines to make assets accessible, acceptable and easy to
        consume for all.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">These standards are intended for individuals and organisations involved in asset
        creation
        and contribution of assets to the SPace Platform.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>What is an asset?</strong></span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">An asset is a bundle of resources that can be used repeatedly to provide various
        benefits. An asset can give ideas, methods, tools, data and connections to imagine and implement a societal
        mission.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take the example of an asset that can help in conducting field research. It can have
        several resources such as a guide (a knowledge resource) which could help the audience with steps to follow in a
        research process, a software which could help analyse qualitative data and a case study of a field research
        conducted by an organisation.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><em>Note: Both assets and resources are Content types recognised on the SPace
          Platform.
          All Content must follow the terms and policies of SPace Platform, including the </em><a
          href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fGVOzIdToEGTSTFBG9XXeS4CurW-fQpNANL9eaf2ldo/edit?usp=sharing"><span
            class="s2"><strong><em>Content Policy &amp; Community
                Guidelines</em></strong></span></a><em>.</em></span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>General considerations</strong></span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Asset creators should ensure that the resources are understandable to different
        individuals (such as social science researchers, technologists, policy makers and programme designers) involved
        in societal missions. The use of resources will vary depending on the context in which users work. It could be
        their sector, functions within organisations, their previous knowledge and so on. A policymaker may want to use
        qualitative data analysis software to analyse policy documents whereas a field researcher may want to use it for
        transcription analysis. Therefore, the value of each asset must be conveyed with appropriate language,
        terminology and supporting information.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Guidelines</strong></span></p>
    <ol class="ol1">
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">An asset with a diverse range of resources can help in ensuring the relevance of
          the asset for all. For example, in the case of an asset on network mapping, some users may only want to
          understand how to map networks while some others may be interested only in the tool that allows them to map
          networks. Thus, we recommend that an asset has different types of resources. This can also help in making an
          asset more valuable for the users. Types of resources including but not limited to:</span></li>
      <ol class="ol2">
        <li class="li2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><span class="s1">Knowledge</span></li>
        <ul class="ul1">

        <li class="li2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><span class="s1">Protocol</span></li>
        <ul class="ul1">
          <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Protocols, in simple terms, are a set of guidelines and procedures that
              deal with a particular subject. It gets manifested in terms of documents on standards and

          <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Protocols provide detailed information on processes and standards for
              interactions between different entities. It could be APIs, hardware specifications, software
              documentation or standards for resource creation, among others.</span></li>

        <ul class="ul1">
          <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Technology refers to software and hardware. Access to microservices in the
              form of a codebase is an example of a technology resource.<span

          <li class="li2"><span class="s1">A curated repository of data in an understandable and consumable form,
